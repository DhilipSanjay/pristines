  A secure electronic voting design is a must for a good democratic system. Making it computerised and cloud-based using blockchain goes a long way in reducing the expenses and also saving the trouble in going to poll stations.
  
  Our design is to provide a username (maybe we can use the existing Voter’s ID) and password to voters. The login takes the voter to the page where the candidates in the particular constituency along with resumes and manifestos is viewable even before the election day. On the election day, the voter can cast his/her vote using password. To make the login process more secure, One Time Password (OTP) is sent to registered mobile number. Needless to say, once the vote is cast from a login, it cannot be cast again.
  
  The bottleneck is to consider the nooks and corners of the nation where internet is not yet easily available and where people don’t use the internet. But it can be transformed into an opportunity to make internet accessible and people aware of the system. We can address those people by placing KIOSKs at selected locations. The KIOSKs also include strong credentials like fingerprint or face recognition tools (This is easier to obtain especially if a unique identification like Aadhar data is available), to make the login process secure. 
  
  Further, in case of the mobile or pc login (by the voters having internet access), if the voter enters the password or the OTP wrongly for three times, the login will be denied for the particular voter. Now, this voter must go to the location where the KIOSKs are available and must login with the fingerprint or face recognition tool.
  
  This login-based system addresses the difficulties faced by the voters, who are not present in their constituency on the election day. The idea can be expanded, but the feasibility in individual system has to be taken into consideration. This makes the inclusion of new voters into the list easy as login can created easily if the unique identification offers the proof of age and residence along with the biometric security. Similarly, the change of constituency is easier if the proof of change of address is available.
  
  The results can be declared immediately at the close of the voting, since everything is computerised. Also, the blockchain technology makes the voting process more transparent (i.e. we can get the list of voters who have/haven’t cast their votes). This will help us to create more awareness about the importance of voting.
